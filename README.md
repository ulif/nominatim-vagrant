# nominatim-vagrant

Vagrant boxes running OSM nominatim


## Install Nominatim

Clone this repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ulif/nominatim-vagrant

Then change into the created repository:

    $ cd nominatim-vagrant/

The local `Vagrantfile` first configures a vagrant box based on Ubuntu 16.04,
installs databases, apache, etc. and then runs the local `installmaps.yml`
ansible playbook.installs map data from different countries.

The set of countries to be installed can be set at top of `installmaps.yml`.

Therefore, edit `installmaps.yml`:

    $ nano installmaps.yml

The nominatim service will be routed from vagrant port 80 to port 8089 of the
host. Edit `Vagrantfile` if you prefer a different port or similar.

Fire up vagrant:

    $ vagrant up ubuntu

This will take a remarkable amount of time, but in the end should give you a
running `virtualbox` where you can log into:

    $ vagrant ssh ubuntu

Before proceeding, these steps must have been finished successfully.


## Using Nominatim

After install, the nominatim service is available at port 8089 of your host
machine. You can browse to

  ` http://localhost:8089/nominatim/search.php

to play with your new nominatim server.

Of course you can also talk via commandline:

    $ curl curl 'http://localhost:8089/nominatim/search.php?format=json&q=17,%20boulevard%20de%20suisse'
    [{"place_id":"100822","licence":"Data Â© OpenStreetMap contributors, ODbL 1.0. http:\/\/www.openstreetmap.org\/copyright",
    "osm_type":"way","osm_id":"94399519","boundingbox":["43.7379492","43.7383593","7.4217809","7.4224633"],
    "lat":"43.7381542","lon":"7.42217981938168","display_name":"Rose de France, 17, Boulevard de Suisse, Monte-Carlo, Monaco, 98000, Monaco",
    "class":"building","type":"yes","importance":0.301}]

Oh, and you need the map data of the country you query, of course.
